- Allow views to use innerHTML to set its template (this would be very tough, need to not use <>)
	! this may break the existing parser.
	? How do you handle recursive nodes in this

- Services
	- acts as an in memory DB
	- create a system that caches responses and what not
	- error handling
	
- General tests

- allow a way for an objec to map a specific variable change to a specific action

- have the templates return back matched variables, have this passed to the observer to save processing.  Have views go off of this data as default.

- remove all of the _ from the different functions.  They are no longer needed besides on models.

- sync all maps and collections so they run off the same interval, reduce overhead

Bugs
- mutated classes can not be extended
- finalizeContent seems to be getting called early
- finalizeContent doesn't get called if there is no template...
