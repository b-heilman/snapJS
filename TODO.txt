- Allow views to use innerHTML to set its template (this would be very tough, need to not use <>)
	! this may break the existing parser.
	? How do you handle recursive nodes in this

- Services
	- acts as an in memory DB
	- create a system that caches responses and what not
	- error handling
	
- General tests

- allow a way for an objec to map a specific variable change to a specific action
- create a Model type, to be used by streams to auto format / populate data
- allow 'defaultTemplate' to be a string or a template definition via a function define

Bugs
- mutated classes can not be extended

Questions
- Should I move all events to the controller?
- Events should be mapped to a property of the controller and not be their own function, allows for better inheretance support
